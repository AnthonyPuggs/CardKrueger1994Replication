# Introduction
David Card and Alan Krueger's 1994 paper, "Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania" was a groundbreaking contribution to the labour economics literature. Prior to the early 90s, over 90% of economists agreed that increases in minimum wage would lead to disemployment effects (ref needed). This helped to kickstart the shift in economists views on minimum wage. It contributed toward the shift of viewing minimum wage effects in a perfectly competitive labour market, to instead a monospony labour market.
